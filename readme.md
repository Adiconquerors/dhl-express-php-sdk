# Unoffical DHL Express PHP SDK

This is *unoffical* library is wrapping some functions of the **DHL Express** JSON/REST API (called MyDHL_API).

To get a SDK for **standard DHL** shipping, please have a look at the great SDK from [Petschko](https://github.com/Petschko/dhl-php-sdk) i've used for inspiration.


## Requirements

- test (and live) credentials from the DHL Express Tech Contact
- PHP-Version 5.5 or higher _(It may work on older Versions, but I don't offer Support for these)_
- [Guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/) installed

## Compatibility

This Project is written for the MyDHL API  **v1**.

## Install

You can use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the package to your project:

`composer require alex-le/dhl-express-php-sdk`

## Usage

see [examples](/examples) for basic examples


More details will follow soon. This package is WIP.
